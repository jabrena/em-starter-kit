description: Cursor rule to create Agile User stories in a conversational way

This rule guides the AI to first ask a series of targeted questions to gather all necessary details for a user story and its associated Gherkin acceptance criteria. After receiving the information, the AI will generate the content for a well-formed user story in Markdown format (linking to the Gherkin file) and a separate Gherkin `.feature` file containing the detailed acceptance criteria.

Instructions for the AI (Content of the Rule):

"When activated, you should guide the user through creating an agile user story and its corresponding Gherkin feature file by following these steps:

Phase 1: Information Gathering
Acknowledge the request and inform the user that you need to ask some questions. Then, ask the following questions, waiting for their input after each block or as appropriate:

**User Story Core Details:**
1.  Title/ID: "What is a concise title or unique ID for this user story?"
2.  User Role (Persona): "Who is the primary user (persona) for this feature? (e.g., 'registered user', 'administrator', 'guest visitor')"
3.  Goal/Action: "What specific action does this user want to perform, or what goal do they want to accomplish with this feature?"
4.  Benefit/Value: "What is the main benefit or value the user will gain from this feature? Why is this important to them?"

**Gherkin Feature File Details:**
5.  Feature Name: "What is a descriptive name for the overall feature these scenarios will cover? (This will be the `Feature:` line in the Gherkin file, e.g., 'User Authentication Management')."
6.  (Optional) Background Steps: "Are there any common setup steps (Given steps) that apply to ALL or most of the scenarios for this feature? If so, please list them."

**Acceptance Criteria / Gherkin Scenarios:**
Inform the user: "Now, let's detail the acceptance criteria with concrete examples. Each distinct scenario or rule will be translated into a Gherkin scenario. For each scenario, please provide a title, the 'Given' (context/preconditions), 'When' (action), and 'Then' (observable outcomes). Include specific data examples where applicable (e.g., input values, expected messages, JSON snippets)."

7.  Scenario 1 (e.g., Main Success Path):
    *   Scenario Title: "What's a brief title for this first scenario?"
    *   Given: "What's the context or precondition(s)?"
    *   When: "What specific action is performed?"
    *   Then: "What are the observable outcome(s)?"
    *   Data Examples: "Any specific data (inputs/outputs) for this scenario?"

8.  Additional Scenarios:
    Ask: "Do you have another scenario to define (e.g., an alternative path, a boundary condition, an error case, or another rule)? (Yes/No)"
    If Yes, repeat the questions from step 7 (Scenario Title, Given, When, Then, Data Examples) for each new scenario. Continue until the user indicates 'No' more scenarios.

**File Naming and Linking:**
9.  User Story Filename: "What should be the filename for the Markdown user story (e.g., `US-001_Login_Functionality.md`)?"
10. Gherkin Filename: "What should be the filename for the Gherkin feature file (e.g., `login_functionality.feature`)?"
11. Relative Path for Linking: "What is the relative path from the user story Markdown file to the Gherkin feature file, so they can be linked correctly? (e.g., `../features/login_functionality.feature` or if in a 'features' subdirectory within the story's directory: `features/login_functionality.feature`)."

**Optional User Story Notes:**
12. Additional Notes: "Are there any other relevant details for the user story Markdown file, such as links to mockups, specific technical constraints, or non-functional requirements?"

Phase 2: Artifact Content Generation
Once all information is gathered, inform the user you will now generate the content for the two files. Then, provide the content for each file clearly separated:

**Content for User Story Markdown File: `[User Story Filename From Input]`**
```markdown
# User Story: [Title/ID From Input]

**As a** [User Role/Persona From Input]
**I want to** [Goal/Action From Input]
**So that** [Benefit/Value From Input]

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The detailed acceptance criteria for this user story, illustrated with concrete examples, are defined in Gherkin format in the following file:
- [`[Gherkin Filename From Input]`]([Relative Path for Linking From Input])

---

## Additional Notes (Optional)

[List Additional Notes From Input, if any, as bullet points]
```

**Content for Gherkin Feature File: `[Gherkin Filename From Input]`**
```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name From Input]

[IF Background Steps were provided THEN
Background:
  [List Background Steps From Input, each prefixed with 'Given ' or 'And ' appropriately]
ENDIF]

[FOR EACH Scenario collected in Step 7 & 8 DO
Scenario: [Scenario Title From Input]
  Given [Given From Input]
  When [When From Input]
  Then [Then From Input]
  [IF Data Examples for scenario were provided THEN include them, possibly as docstrings or tables formatted appropriately for Gherkin ENDIF]

ENDLOOP]
```

Ensure the Gherkin output for data examples is illustrative of how to use docstrings for JSON/XML or tables for structured data if the user provides complex examples.
