# Definition of Done, DoD

## Backend Development (Java)

A feature or user story for backend Java development is considered "Done" when all of the following criteria are met:

*   **Code Complete:** All planned coding tasks for the feature are completed.
*   **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests are written and executed, covering all new or modified code. All unit tests must pass.
*   **Integration Tests:** Relevant integration tests are written and executed to ensure that the new feature integrates correctly with other system components. All integration tests must pass.
*   **Code Review:** The code has been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. All review comments have been addressed.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Relevant technical documentation (e.g., API documentation, design documents) has been created or updated.
    *   Code comments are clear, concise, and explain non-obvious logic.
*   **Build and Deployment:**
    *   The application builds successfully without errors or warnings.
    *   The feature is successfully deployed to a designated test/staging environment.
*   **Functional Acceptance:** The feature meets all defined functional requirements and acceptance criteria as specified in the user story or task.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    *   **Performance:** The feature meets any specified performance criteria (e.g., response times, resource utilization).
    *   **Security:** Potential security vulnerabilities have been considered and addressed according to security best practices and project guidelines. No known critical or high-severity vulnerabilities exist.
    *   **Scalability:** The design and implementation consider scalability requirements.
    *   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and logging mechanisms are in place.
*   **Code Quality:**
    *   Code adheres to established coding standards and style guides.
    *   Code is clean, maintainable, and avoids unnecessary complexity.
    *   No major static analysis warnings or "code smells" are present.
*   **Database Changes:** Any necessary database schema changes have been scripted, reviewed, and applied. Data migrations, if any, are tested.
*   **Configuration Management:** All configuration changes are documented and managed appropriately.
*   **Merge:** The feature branch has been successfully merged into the main development branch (e.g., `develop` or `main`) after passing all checks.
*   **Testing by QA (if applicable):** The feature has been tested by the Quality Assurance team (if part of the workflow) and any reported bugs have been resolved.
*   **Product Owner Acceptance (if applicable):** The Product Owner or relevant stakeholder has reviewed and accepted the completed feature.

This Definition of Done serves as a checklist to ensure quality and consistency in our backend development process. It should be reviewed and agreed upon by the entire development team.
