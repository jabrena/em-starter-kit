# Sprint planning

A sprint planning session, held every two weeks, is a collaborative event where the team decides what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how that work will be achieved. This document outlines a typical session involving the Product Owner (PO), Tech Lead (TL), Senior Software Engineers (SrSE), and Software Engineers (SE), drawing upon common agile practices and role responsibilities.

## Participants and Their Roles

Based on a typical RACI matrix for IT roles, the involvement in sprint planning is as follows:

*   **Product Owner (PO):**
    *   *Accountable* for defining the product vision and managing the product backlog. This means they have the final say on what the priorities are.
    *   *Responsible* for aspects of driving software development and delivery, primarily by clarifying requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
    *   *Consulted* on managing technical projects and timelines, providing input on scope and priority trade-offs.

*   **Tech Lead (TL):**
    *   *Responsible* for managing technical projects & timelines within the sprint.
    *   *Responsible* for driving software development & delivery by guiding the technical approach.
    *   *Accountable* for ensuring code quality and adherence to engineering standards, which starts with proper planning.
    *   *Consulted* on the product vision and backlog, helping to assess technical feasibility and dependencies.

*   **Senior Software Engineer (SrSE):**
    *   *Responsible* for driving software development & delivery by contributing to technical design and implementation plans.
    *   *Responsible* for ensuring code quality and engineering standards through their expertise and input.
    *   *Consulted* on the product vision, backlog, and managing technical projects & timelines, offering insights on complexity and potential solutions.

*   **Software Engineer (SE):**
    *   *Responsible* for driving software development & delivery by participating in task breakdown and implementation discussions.
    *   *Responsible* for ensuring code quality and engineering standards by understanding and contributing to the planned approach.

## Typical Sprint Planning Session Flow

The session typically unfolds in the following stages:

1.  **Objective Setting & Backlog Presentation (Led by PO):**
    *   The **PO** initiates the meeting. They present the highest priority items from the product backlog that are candidates for the sprint.
    *   For each item, the PO clearly explains the user story, its business value, and detailed acceptance criteria.
    *   The PO answers questions from the development team (TL, SrSEs, SEs) to ensure a shared understanding of *what* needs to be built and *why* it's important.
    *   The **TL** and **SrSEs**, being *Consulted* on the backlog, actively engage to ensure clarity and technical feasibility from the outset.

2.  **"How" Discussion: Design and Task Breakdown (Facilitated by TL, with SrSEs and SEs):**
    *   With a clear understanding of the "what," the discussion shifts to "how" the work will be accomplished. The **TL**, who is *Responsible* for managing technical projects and timelines, usually facilitates this part.
    *   The development team (**TL, SrSEs, SEs**) collaboratively discusses the technical design and approach for each selected backlog item.
    *   **SrSEs** often take the lead in discussing more complex items, proposing solutions, identifying potential technical challenges or dependencies, and assisting in breaking down larger stories into smaller, manageable technical tasks.
    *   **SEs** actively participate by asking clarifying questions, offering implementation ideas, and contributing to the task breakdown and estimation.
    *   The PO remains available to answer any functional questions that arise during the technical discussion, ensuring the proposed solutions align with the requirements.

3.  **Effort Estimation (Development Team):**
    *   The development team (**TL, SrSEs, SEs**) collaboratively estimates the effort required for each identified task. Common techniques include story points, ideal days, or t-shirt sizing.
    *   The **TL** ensures that the team considers dependencies between tasks, potential risks, and the team's overall capacity for the sprint.

4.  **Sprint Backlog Commitment (Development Team, confirmed with PO):**
    *   Based on their available capacity and the effort estimations, the development team (**TL, SrSEs, SEs**) selects the set of product backlog items they are confident they can complete to a "done" state within the sprint. This selection forms the Sprint Backlog.
    *   The **PO** and the development team then agree on a Sprint Goal – a concise statement describing what the team aims to achieve during the sprint. This goal provides focus and a shared objective.
    *   The **TL** plays a crucial role in ensuring this commitment is realistic and sustainable, aligning with their responsibility for managing timelines and upholding engineering standards.

## Key Interactions & Dynamics

*   **Collaboration is Paramount:** Sprint planning is a highly collaborative event. While the PO defines the "what" and the development team determines the "how," success depends on open communication and joint problem-solving.
*   **Continuous Clarification:** A constant feedback loop exists where the PO clarifies requirements, and the development team asks questions to ensure a deep and shared understanding before committing to the work.
*   **Technical Guidance:** The **TL** and **SrSEs** provide essential technical leadership, helping to identify and mitigate risks, evaluate different technical options, and ensure that the planned work aligns with architectural guidelines and quality standards.
*   **Shared Ownership:** The entire scrum team, including the PO and all members of the development team, should feel a collective sense of ownership over the Sprint Goal and the Sprint Backlog. This shared commitment is vital for a successful sprint.

This structured approach to sprint planning aims to create a clear, achievable plan for the upcoming sprint, ensuring that all team members are aligned on the objectives and the work required to meet them.
