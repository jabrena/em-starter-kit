# Definition of Ready, DoR

## Backend Development (Java)

A user story or task for backend Java development is considered "Ready" to be worked on when all of the following criteria are met:

*   **Clearly Defined User Story/Task:**
    *   The user story or task is well-defined, understandable, and has a clear goal or objective.
    *   Acceptance criteria are explicitly stated, measurable, and testable.
    *   The value to the end-user or business is clear.
*   **Dependencies Identified and Resolved/Planned:**
    *   All external dependencies (e.g., other teams, services, APIs) are identified.
    *   Dependent work is either completed, or a clear plan and timeline for its completion are in place.
    *   Any necessary access or credentials for dependent systems are available.
*   **Technical Requirements Understood:**
    *   Sufficient technical details are provided or understood by the development team.
    *   Potential technical challenges or risks have been discussed and, where possible, mitigated or have a plan for investigation.
    *   The scope of changes to existing systems or services is understood.
*   **API Contracts (if applicable):**
    *   If the work involves creating or consuming APIs, the API contract (e.g., request/response formats, endpoints, authentication) is defined and agreed upon.
    *   For new APIs, a preliminary design is available.
*   **Data Requirements (if applicable):**
    *   Data sources, schemas, and any data transformation logic are understood.
    *   If new database tables or schema changes are needed, they are identified.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements Considered:**
    *   Initial thoughts on relevant non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as performance, security, scalability, and logging have been discussed.
    *   Specific NFRs that significantly impact design should be outlined.
*   **UX/UI Specifications (if applicable for APIs consumed by frontend):**
    *   If the backend work directly supports a user interface, relevant wireframes, mockups, or UI specifications are available to understand the context and data needs.
*   **Testability:**
    *   The story/task is defined in a way that allows for testable outcomes (both unit and integration tests).
    *   Key scenarios for testing are considered.
*   **Estimation and Sizing:**
    *   The story/task has been estimated by the development team and is considered feasible to complete within a sprint or iteration.
    *   The task is small enough to be manageable; large stories are broken down.
*   **Team Understanding and Agreement:**
    *   The development team has had an opportunity to discuss the story/task, ask clarifying questions, and has a shared understanding of what needs to be done.
    *   There is agreement that the story/task is ready for development to begin.

This Definition of Ready helps ensure that the development team has all the necessary information and prerequisites to start working on a task efficiently and effectively, reducing ambiguity and potential rework.
