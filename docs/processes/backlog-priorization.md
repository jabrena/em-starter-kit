## Backlog Prioritization Session Structure (EM, PO, TL)

This session aims to collaboratively prioritize the product backlog, ensuring alignment between product vision, technical feasibility, and engineering capacity.

**Attendees:**

*   **Product Owner (PO):** Represents business/customer needs, clarifies item value, and makes final prioritization decisions.
*   **Tech Lead (TL):** Provides technical insights, effort estimations, identifies dependencies, and highlights risks.
*   **Engineering Manager (EM):** Facilitates the meeting, ensures discussion stays on track, helps resolve conflicts, and considers team capacity and health.

**I. Preparation (Before the Session):**

1.  **PO:**
    *   Ensure the backlog items (User Stories, Tasks, Bugs) are well-defined, understandable, and have clear acceptance criteria (if applicable).
    *   Come with an initial view on the desired outcomes or themes for the upcoming period.
    *   Gather any relevant data (user feedback, market analysis, business goals) to support prioritization.
2.  **TL:**
    *   Pre-groom complex or high-risk items with the team if necessary to get a better understanding of technical implications.
    *   Think about potential architectural impacts or dependencies.
3.  **EM:**
    *   Book the meeting, ensuring all key participants can attend.
    *   Define a clear agenda and timebox for the session.
    *   Ensure any necessary tools (e.g., backlog management tool, virtual whiteboard) are ready.

**II. Session Agenda (Example):**

1.  **Opening & Goal Setting (5-10 mins)**
    *   **EM:** Welcome, reiterate the purpose of the session (e.g., "Prioritize the backlog for the next sprint/quarter").
    *   **PO:** Briefly outline any overarching product goals or strategic themes relevant to this prioritization.
2.  **Review of Unprioritized/Candidate Items (15-20 mins)**
    *   **PO:** Walks through the list of items to be considered for prioritization. For each item, briefly explain its purpose and intended value.
3.  **Discussion & Information Gathering (30-60 mins, depending on backlog size)**
    *   For each significant item (or group of related items):
        *   **PO:** Clarifies business value, urgency, customer impact. Answers "Why is this important?"
        *   **TL:** Discusses technical feasibility, estimated effort (e.g., story points, t-shirt sizes), dependencies, potential risks, and any technical prerequisites or enablers. Answers "What will it take?"
        *   **EM:** Facilitates discussion, ensures everyone's input is heard, helps clarify ambiguities, and keeps an eye on overall team capacity and potential roadblocks.
4.  **Prioritization Exercise (20-40 mins)**
    *   Choose a prioritization method. Examples:
        *   **MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have):** Good for defining scope.
        *   **Value vs. Effort Matrix:** Plot items on a 2x2 matrix (High Value/Low Effort, High Value/High Effort, etc.).
        *   **RICE Scoring (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort):** More quantitative.
        *   **Stack Ranking:** Simply ordering items from most to least important.
    *   **PO:** Leads the prioritization based on the discussion, using the chosen framework. The final call on priority rests with the PO, but it should be heavily informed by the TL's and EM's input.
    *   **TL & EM:** Provide input and challenge assumptions to ensure a realistic and achievable prioritized list.
5.  **Review & Confirmation (10-15 mins)**
    *   **PO:** Presents the newly prioritized backlog.
    *   **All:** Review the top N items to ensure shared understanding and agreement.
    *   Discuss any immediate next steps (e.g., breaking down large items, further refinement needed for top items).
6.  **Closing (5 mins)**
    *   **EM:** Summarize key decisions and action items. Thank participants.

**III. Post-Session:**

1.  **PO:** Update the backlog in the relevant tool to reflect the new priorities. Communicate the prioritized backlog to the development team and other stakeholders.
2.  **TL:** Discuss any technical follow-ups or deeper analysis needed with the team.
3.  **EM:** Follow up on any action items assigned during the meeting.

**Key Success Factors:**

*   **Clear Product Vision & Goals:** Provides context for prioritization.
*   **Prepared Participants:** Everyone should do their homework.
*   **Open & Honest Communication:** Create a safe space for discussion and disagreement.
*   **Focus on Outcomes:** Prioritize work that delivers the most value.
*   **Data-Informed Decisions:** Use data (user feedback, metrics, effort estimates) whenever possible.
*   **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adapt the process as needed.
*   **Regular Cadence:** Make this a recurring session to keep the backlog healthy and aligned.

**Session Frequency:**

*   **Alignment with Sprints:** For teams with two-week sprints, holding this session bi-weekly often aligns well with the planning cycle. This ensures consistent focus on the most valuable work for the upcoming sprint.
*   **Monthly as an Alternative:** A monthly cadence can be suitable if sprints are longer, the product roadmap is more stable, or if supplemented by robust ongoing backlog refinement.
*   **Factors to Consider:** The ideal frequency depends on your sprint length, the dynamism of your product environment, the maturity of your backlog, and team preferences. It's advisable to start with a more frequent cadence (e.g., bi-weekly) and adjust based on effectiveness and need.
*   **Not a Replacement for Refinement:** This strategic prioritization session is complementary to, and does not replace, regular backlog refinement activities undertaken by the PO and the development team.

This structure provides a comprehensive framework. You can adjust the time allocations and specific activities based on your team's context and the number of items to review.
