# Squad reporting

## Reporting Progress from Product Owner to Engineering Manager

In a Scrum framework, the Product Owner (PO) can effectively report progress to the Engineering Manager (EM) by leveraging standard Scrum events and artifacts. This ensures transparency and alignment on the squad's advancements.

Here's a recommended approach:

### 1. Sprint Review
This is the primary event for showcasing the work completed during the Sprint.
*   **PO's Role:** The PO should ensure the Sprint Review is a collaborative session where the Scrum Team demonstrates the "Done" increment.
*   **Reporting to EM:** The EM should be invited to the Sprint Review. The PO can explicitly highlight how the completed work contributes to the overall product goals and roadmap. Discuss any deviations, learnings, and feedback received.

### 2. Regular Check-ins (e.g., Weekly or Bi-Weekly)
While Scrum events provide formal touchpoints, brief, regular check-ins between the PO and EM can be beneficial.
*   **Focus:**
    *   Progress towards the Sprint Goal.
    *   Key accomplishments and milestones reached.
    *   Current and anticipated impediments or risks (and mitigation efforts).
    *   Updates or changes to the Product Backlog (e.g., new insights, re-prioritization based on stakeholder feedback).
    *   Team morale and any support needed from the EM.

### 3. Utilizing Scrum Artifacts
*   **Product Backlog:** The PO should maintain a transparent and well-ordered Product Backlog. The EM can review this artifact to understand the long-term vision, upcoming work, and overall progress.
*   **Sprint Backlog & Burndown Charts:** These artifacts provide a snapshot of the current Sprint's progress. The PO can share these (or ensure the EM has access) to visualize work remaining and the team's trajectory towards the Sprint Goal.
*   **Release Burndown Chart (if applicable):** For longer-term releases, this chart shows progress towards a larger set of features.

### Key Information to Convey:
*   **Achievements:** What has been accomplished since the last update?
*   **Alignment:** How does this progress align with the Sprint Goal and broader product/business objectives?
*   **Roadblocks:** What impediments are hindering progress, and what support is needed?
*   **Learnings:** What has the team learned that might impact future plans?
*   **Next Steps:** What are the immediate priorities?

By combining insights from Scrum events with targeted communication and transparent artifacts, the PO can provide the EM with a comprehensive understanding of the squad's progress.
