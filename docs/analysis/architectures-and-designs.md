# Comparison of Architect and Tech Lead Roles

Based on the RACI matrix in `docs/raci/raci.md`:

*   **Enterprise Architect (EA):**
    *   **Accountable (A)** for: Developing & Maintaining Enterprise Architecture.
    *   **Responsible (R)** for: Evaluating & Select New Technologies/Platforms, Developing & Maintaining Enterprise Architecture (alongside SolA for the latter).
    *   **Consulted (C)** for: Designing Solution Architecture for New Initiatives, Developing & Maintaining Enterprise Architecture, Driving Innovation & Continuous Improvement, Defining IT Strategy & Long-Term Roadmap, Developing & Enforce IT Policies & Governance, Overseeing IT Security, Risk & Compliance.
    *   The EA focuses on the bigger picture, long-term strategy, and maintenance of the overall enterprise architecture. They are accountable for the enterprise architecture itself and play a significant role in technology selection and innovation.

*   **Solution Architect (SolA):**
    *   **Accountable (A)** for: Designing Solution Architecture for New Initiatives.
    *   **Responsible (R)** for: Evaluating & Select New Technologies/Platforms, Design Solution Architecture for New Initiatives, Develop & Maintain Enterprise Architecture, Drive Innovation & Continuous Improvement, Create & Maintain Technical Documentation.
    *   **Consulted (C)** for: Designing Solution Architecture for New Initiatives (also R), Resolve Complex Tech Issues & Expert Support, Manage Stakeholder Relationships & Comm., Define IT Strategy & Long-Term Roadmap, Oversee IT Security, Risk & Compliance, Manage Technical Projects & Timelines, Define Product Vision & Manage Product Backlog, Drive Software Development & Delivery.
    *   The SolA is focused on designing specific solutions for new projects, translating enterprise architecture into actionable plans. They are accountable for the architecture of specific initiatives and are heavily involved in the technical aspects of project delivery and documentation.

*   **Tech Lead (TL):**
    *   **Accountable (A)** for: Ensuring Code Quality & Engineering Standards.
    *   **Responsible (R)** for: Evaluating & Select New Technologies/Platforms, Design Solution Architecture for New Initiatives, Drive Innovation & Continuous Improvement, Lead & Develop IT Department/Teams, Resolve Complex Tech Issues & Expert Support, Manage Stakeholder Relationships & Comm., Oversee IT Security, Risk & Compliance, Manage Technical Projects & Timelines, Create & Maintain Technical Documentation, Drive Software Development & Delivery.
    *   **Consulted (C)** for: Develop & Maintain Enterprise Architecture, Manage IT Budget & Resources, Manage IT Infrastructure & Operations, Define IT Strategy & Long-Term Roadmap, Develop & Enforce IT Policies & Governance, Define Product Vision & Manage Product Backlog.
    *   The TL is more hands-on with the development team and process. They are accountable for code quality and engineering standards. They are responsible for a wide range of activities, including aspects of solution design, innovation, team leadership, technical issue resolution, and project management. They bridge the gap between architectural decisions and actual implementation.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

*   **Scope:**
    *   **EA:** Broadest scope, focuses on the entire enterprise, long-term vision, and standards.
    *   **SolA:** Project-specific scope, designs architectures for particular initiatives, translating enterprise strategy into solutions.
    *   **TL:** Team/delivery-focused scope, ensures quality and execution of development, leads the technical aspects of a team.
*   **Accountability:**
    *   **EA:** Accountable for the overall Enterprise Architecture.
    *   **SolA:** Accountable for the Solution Architecture of specific new initiatives.
    *   **TL:** Accountable for Code Quality & Engineering Standards.
*   **Primary Focus:**
    *   **EA:** Strategic alignment, technology governance, and long-term architectural health.
    *   **SolA:** Designing effective and feasible solutions for specific business problems/projects.
    *   **TL:** Technical leadership of the development team, ensuring best practices, and successful delivery of software.

While there's overlap in responsibilities, particularly in being "Responsible" or "Consulted" for various tasks (e.g., all three are "Responsible" for "Evaluate & Select New Technologies/Platforms" and "Design Solution Architecture for New Initiatives" to some extent), their primary accountability and the breadth of their focus differentiate them significantly. The EA looks at the forest, the SolA designs specific groves of trees, and the TL ensures the trees in their grove are healthy and well-tended.
